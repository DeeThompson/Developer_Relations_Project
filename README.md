## Running The Project 



### Running demo projects locally

Each demo project is an independent standalone project. You can choose to run a single project, or the entire demo project site.

### Running a single demo project

Using the `static-demos` project as an example:

```bash
# From daily-demos
nvm i
cd static-demos/
npm i
npm run start # or `npm run dev`, to automatically restart server on file changes
```

Then open your browser and go to `localhost:<port>`, using the `port` printed in the terminal after running the above.

### Running the entire demo project site

```bash
# From daily-demos
nvm i
npm i
npm run start # or `npm run dev`, to automatically restart server on file changes
```

Then open your browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) or [localhost:3001](http://locahost:3001).
